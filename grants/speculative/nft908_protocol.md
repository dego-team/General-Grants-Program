# NFT908 Protocol

* **Project:** NFT908 Protocol


## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Project Description

At the end of 2017, an application based on ERC721, called CryptoKitties, took place and boosted the development of the NFT market. As the depth and width of NFT have been continuously improved for these few years, the shortcomings of the 721 protocol have also emerged. Although we have some new subsequent protocols such as ERC1155, ERC918 and many other relevant NFT protocols, they are still having major flaws under the following application scenarios:


1.The rental scenario of NFT. As compared with FT, where integers are used to describe the capitalization of properties, NFT adopted a structural way to describe many attributes of an asset, in which way the descriptive ability is way better that of an FT. The most important feature of ERC721 NFT assets is the ownership of the assets. But in reality, only a certain period of right-of-use rather than ownership is transferred such as the rental of real estate and car rental scenarios. Therefore, we need to describe the right-of-use of NFT assets and separate the ownership from the right-of-use.


The portfolio of NFT. In RPGs, a full set of legendary gears typically have upper-body armour, lower-body armour, weapons, etc. A fine weapon may be further upgraded by various gems to improve its attack, defence and other relevant attributes. These complex traits of combinations need support from NFT.


Parallel uses of NFT. After CryptoKitties has first been introduced, some Dapps use the NFT property of CryptoKitties to form up services where CryptoKitties can fight each other, or kitties are given new and different attributes. But these new characteristics have deviated from the original NFT protocol of CryptoKitties and the new traits are separated. We need the NFT to be given different traits in different Dapps, and these traits should be able to practice sharing with ease.


Based on our study and experience in NFT, on top of ERC721 protocol of Ethereum, we are making use of the Polkadot network and forming a new NFT protocol, addressing all the issues that are mentioned above, making the NFT protocols enabled by Polkadot wider, adding up to the variety of the on-chain NFT assets.

We would like to make NFT908 Protocol the standard NFT protocol for the Polkadot ecosystem and provide an open-source library to all developers in the Polkadot ecosystem, lowering the development cost for relevant NFT, making NFT908 an infrastructure for Polkadot, and bringing prosperity for the Polkadot ecosystem.


### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $100k.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** $5,000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.
